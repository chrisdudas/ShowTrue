ShowTrue
========

Select a folder that contains any shows and this script will pull down the titles of the shows and rename to be nice and presentable
e.g. American.Dad.S06E02.HDTV.XviD-LOL.avi => American Dad 6x02 - Son of Stan (2).avi

This is just an old project I decided to put up so there are bound to be plenty of bugs hidden
